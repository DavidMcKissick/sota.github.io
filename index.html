            <h3>What's SOTA?</h3>
            <p>SOTA is a free to play tabletop RPG system made for players looking
                for something a little different with a more free form class system
                and a heavy focus on DM freedoms.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>What does it cost?</h3>
            <p>The core rulebook is completely free to everyone. This book is the master
                book for the game and will remain free throughout at least the first edition
                plus first edition updates. Future releases may cost a nominal fee of a couple
                dollars in digital format but the first edition will be around for quite a while.
                <br><br>
                As well as this, I plan to release expansion pamphlets for new skill trees, mechanics,
                and so on for free during the 1.x edition cycle to provide as much free content as 
                possible.

            <h3>Updates? On a tabletop RPG?</h3>
            <p>Correct. A lot of games only release in whole editions which, while great for
                old physical formats, limits balance tweaks, fixes of various sorts, etc. So
                each edition will come with free updates for the edition(s) you own. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>What about the future?</h3>
            <p>In the future I'm considering charging small amounts just to fuel further content and
                help with bills. This will probably start around second edition (2.x) and cost maybe 
                5-10 dollars at most. This wont be for a long while however as I plan to work on 1.x 
                for a hot minute to get things nice and cleanly balanced and fun.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Will I lose access to 1.x once 2.x comes out?</h3>
            <p>Nope. 1.x is free for the lifetime of this project. You'll be able to play it 
                forever and most future expansions will be compatible with 1.x. Frankly the
                only real reason to buy 2.x when it comes is to support my work and get a 
                prettier presentation and some new features and tweaks.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>When does it come out?</h3>
            <p>When it does. Alpha 1 will come out in the next few months depending on how much
                time I get to work on it. This edition will be a broken mess but it will at least
                be playable.
